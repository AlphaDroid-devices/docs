### Formatting
The formatting for instructions page is [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

- 3 hashtags (#) represent header
- asterisk (*) represents bullet
- backtick (`) represents code tag (used for example when you need to write something in terminal - to easy copy/paste)
- urls are written with brackets [url name here] followed by parenthesis (https://url.com)

Download [template.md](https://github.com/crdroidandroid/install_docs/blob/live/template.md) file locally, make edits and submit pull request to proper folder representing crDroid version.
